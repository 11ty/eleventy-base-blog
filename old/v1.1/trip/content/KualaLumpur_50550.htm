Reverse Culture Shock - I believe is the correct term. I arrived in KL and got picked up by my friend at the airport, who drove me to my accommodation. Now, it just so happens that my mates family own a very successful chain of hotels (<A HREF="http://www.kl-hotels.com/grand_continental" TARGET="win1">Grand Continental</A>) across Malaysia.  So when I walked into my new room, I didn't walk into some drab room with insects crawling around the floor, as had been the norm for the last 6 weeks. Instead I couldn't believe my eyes when my mate showed me into one of the hotel's suites. I didn't even dare sit down. Eventually my mate convinced to take a seat, so I cautiously sat down on the edge of the bed. Wow!

KL is a nice city, quite developed, it's one of the major shopping destinations in Asia for rich tourists.  In view of this, I am hardly surprised at the number of shopping centres in this city. Buildingwise, the <A HREF="http://www.skyscrapers.org/tallest/t_petronas.htm" TARGET="win1">Petronas Towers</A> are certainly very impressive, but there are (or were then) a plethora of half finished high rise buildings, a legacy of the Asian tiger economy gone bust. Personally, I thought KL was OK, but it wasn't exceptional and was not that interesting.

My mate kindly organised a couple of day trips to various historical towns. <A HREF="http://www.malacca.net" TARGET="win1">Melaka</A>, on the west coast, south of KL, is very interesting, having been settled by the Portuguese, Dutch and English at various points in history. Also impressive are the <A HREF="http://www.lunaterna.net/singmala/batucave.htm" TARGET="win1">Batu caves</A>. These are vast caves with various Hindu shrines hewn into them.  Plenty of monkeys around the place add to the peculiar atmosphere. Thanking Min for the wonderful time I had in KL, I got a train to Singapore, about 3 hours south.</TD>
