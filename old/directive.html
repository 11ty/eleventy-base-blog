			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
			  On this site you will find information about the Web Accessibility Directive, also known as the <acronym title="Web Accessibility Directive">WAD</acronym>.
			  The WAD is a piece of legislation of the European Union that requires some websites to be accessible to persons with disabilities.
			  The websites it applies to are those belonging to the public sector, such the government, local councils or the police.
			</p>
