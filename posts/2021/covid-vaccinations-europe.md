With last month's arguments between the EU and UK, regarding vaccine contracts and deliveries I did some back of an envelope analysis. It seems the real issue is not so much contracts, but the general lack of vacciness, partially due to the inability of one specific manufacturer to deliver their promised amounts of vaccines. Here are the stats as of the 10th April 2021:
  
<table>
  <caption>Vaccination progress for the EU and UK</caption>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <th>EU</th>
    <th>UK</th>
    <th>Combined</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Doses given (millions)</th>
    <td>93</td>
    <td>39</td>
    <td>132</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Population (millions)</th>
    <td>445</td>
    <td>68</td>
    <td>513</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Ratio doses to population</th>
    <td>0.21</td>
    <td>0.57</td>
    <td>0.26</td>
  </tr>
</table>

As can be seen from the table if all the vaccine doses administered by the 10th April had been spread evenly across the EU and the UK, the effect on the vaccination rate of the EU would have been minimal: an increase of 5 doses per 100 inhabitants.  But in the UK the effect would have been drastic: a decrease of 31 doses per 100 in habitants. So whilst complaints about vaccine export controls and contracts mimicking such export controls might be valid, the real issue is the limited capacity to produce the vaccines. This is where the focus needs to be - not on blaming each other for hoarding vaccines.
