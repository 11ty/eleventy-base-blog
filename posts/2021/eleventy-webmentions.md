<p>
It's finally done. I migrated my site from <a href="https://robinmassart.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> to a static site generated by <a href="https://11ty.dev">eleventy</a>. I've also managed to get <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">webmentions</a> working of a sort. Many thanks for all the great help available on the internet.

I list here some sites I found especially helpful, but of course there are many others who gave me a nudge in the right direction.</p>
