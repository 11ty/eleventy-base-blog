Thanks to a <a href="https://adactio.com/links/17811">post by Jeremy Keith</a>, I came across this post by Remy Sharp on the changing web and <a href="https://remysharp.com/2021/02/11/the-web-didnt-change-you-did">framework fatigue</a>.</p>

The point he makes, much better than I can, is that the web actually has not changed and you can still develop like it's 1999 if you wish. Your site will still work. It's up to you if you want to keep up with all the latest JavaScript frameworks. They are useful for some, probably overkill for many. However, keeping an eye on the latest developments is generally a good thing.

He then goes on to make the point that browsers are incredibly backward compatible and will still display 20 year old web pages with no errors and happily run the JavaScript within them.  So I thought I'd give that a go with my implementation of <a href="https://staticrobinmassart.nfshost.com/old/v2/default68c2.html">Sokoban in JavaScript</a> from just about 20 years ago. I think I wrote that code in late 2001. It stil works. And of course runs noticably quicker than it did back then. Unfortunately it still has the same old lame graphics!
