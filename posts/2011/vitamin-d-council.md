It is Minervation's highest traffic website and required the development of a caching system to ensure it could be hosted efficiently. It also makes extensive use of the news section, image manager and the taxonomy module for the Health Conditions section.</p>

<p>The website also includes a frequent and free newsletter as well as a largely members only Wordpress blog for discussing all things Vitamin D. The site was launched in May 2011, with the members blog going live about 3 months later.</p>
<p><strong>Launch date:</strong> 18th May 2011</p>
