All services are offered free of charge.</p>

<p>In 2006 Minervation launched a redesigned site for PBCC as part of larger upgrade to their IT systems (not handled by Minervation). Note: The current PBCC live site is not the one I worked, on as they implemented a new site a couple of years later.</p>
<p><strong>Launch date:</strong> 8th November 2006</p>
