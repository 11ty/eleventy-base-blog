<p><img src="/assets/images/pif.png" alt="Homepage of the PIF website" width="300" height="227" />The Patient Information Forum (PiF) is an independent social enterprise supporting professionals in the provision of high quality Consumer Health Information - across the NHS, commercial, voluntary and academic sectors.</p>

<p>We started work on the PiF website in 2005. PiF is a membership based organisation, thus this site includes a basic membership management module tailored to PiFs needs at the time. Technically the most interesting aspect of this site was the integration with Campaign Monitor to send out the weekly newsletter that PiF sends to it's members. Campaign Monitor helps newsletter authors track the success of their newsletter campaigns. This site has seen a number of redesigns since its launch.</p>
<p><strong>Launch date:</strong> 28th February 2006.</p>
