<p><img src="/assets/images/thinkwell.png" alt="Homepage of Ð¢hinkwell" width="300" height="217" /> ThinkWell is about getting involved in health care. This is not one the prettier sites I have worked on! As far as I remember it was launched as a favour and in a hurry, without the input of a professional designer. Still, it is there and provides a discussion forum for its users.</p>
