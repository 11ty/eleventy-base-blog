<p><img src="/assets/images/csm.png" alt="Homepage of Centre for Statistics in Medicine">The Oxford based Centre for Statistics in Medicine collaborates in health care research, conducts applied statistical research and runs training courses/workshops for both health care workers and statisticians. Another site launched in early 2005 on one of the earliest version of Minervation's in house CMS (Phaedrus). It has since undergone a number of upgrades, although the design has stayed pretty much the same.</p>
