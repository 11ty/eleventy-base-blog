<p>A little while back a number of well known web developers, designers and authors launched the <a title="Link to the Future Friendly website" href="http://futurefriend.ly/">futurefriend.ly</a> website. The gist of the site is to propose an approach to developing web sites and web application in a future friendly way. That is in a way which enables the content of the application to still be accessible years into the future.</p>

<p>Coming more from a software engineering background I see similarities here with the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> that was formulated about 10 years ago. So here's my initial attempt at a Future Friendly Manifesto:</p>
<blockquote class="future-friendly-manifesto">
<p><span class="more-important">Great content</span> over good looks<br /><span class="more-important">Accessible usability</span> over functionality<br /><span class="more-important">Web based applications</span> over device specific applications<br /><span class="more-important">Open standards</span> over proprietory implementations</p>
<div class="explain">That is, while there is value in the items on<br />the right, we value the items on the left more.</div>
</blockquote>
