<p><img src="/assets/images/acta.png" alt="ACTA Community Theatre homepage" width="300" height="229" />Minervation have just launched a new, WordPress based, website for the ACTA Community Theatre in Bristol. Whilst I no longer work for Minervation and didn't finish this website, I did help in laying the ground work for it and specifically sorting out the various homepage streams.</p>

<p>I really like this site, as it is heavily image based and does a wonderful job of presenting the theatre's work. Why not have a look and books a ticket to view an event?</p>
<p><strong>Launch date:</strong> October 2012</p>
