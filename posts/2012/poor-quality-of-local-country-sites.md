<p>Good article from Nielsen about the quality of local international sites: <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/country-site.html">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/country-site.html</a></p>
<p>In my opinion the worst offenders are those who redirect you to the local website based on your IP address.</p>
