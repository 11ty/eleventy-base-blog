<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> My name is Jackson Goode. I was born in Charlotte, NC and studied at Occidental College in Los
Angeles, CA where I graduated with a degree in cognitive science. I've completed a masterâ€™s degree
in music, communications and technology at the <a
href="https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/mct-master/">University of Oslo</a>. I currently
work as a platform engineer at <a href="https://nline.io/">
    <em>n</em>Line</a> where we monitor the
electrical grid of cities in Sub-Saharan Africa. </p>

<p>Besides the formal elements, I play guitar, make playlists, watch movies, read books, write a
bit, build collages, and other things that I'll publicize digitally one day (here are some of <a
href="{{ site.url }}/favorites">my favorites</a>).</p>

<p>Here's what I've been listening to!</p>
