Almost two years later, I've continued to contribute to this growing catalog of "music videos" and thought it might be time to jump back in with more discussion of a select few films, the music I chose for them and the nuance in-between. Unintentionally, I've continued to watch, enjoy and incorporate films without color. Maybe it's the nostalgia for a time unknown, or just that there are a lot of good movies spread over the years. Since the series has been steadily growing, I think it's about time to discuss another two with the theme of color in mind.

## La Jet√©e

Chris Marker is a real treasure. Though I have many of his films on my watchlist, the few I've seen have placed him in a category of his own. Often filled with simple scenes, transformed through narration, or, in his later works, digital manipulations, Marker poses questions unanswerable and opens boxes hidden under a lens or in plain sight. There's a mysterious fan, whose Marker related videos have been floating around YouTube that [might be making a documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekenS1hRwoU). It ought to be interesting if/when it comes out.

La Jet√©e is just an incredible film. Some point fun at it as ["the best powerpoint in the world"](https://letterboxd.com/film/la-jetee/), of course for the project's most striking decision: the absence of motion. It's for this reason even Marker describes La Jet√©e as a "photo novel" rather than a film. La Jet√©e consists of a series of black and white photos of a post-apocoylptic Paris, a world shattered by bombs and the aftermath of human failure. They are presented in what is at times chronological and at others skipping wearily through time and space. The photos we see appear as frames from the memory of our protagonist, a prisoner, forced to revisit his past in order to find a key to secure the future of humanity. Without spoiling, the film is a existentialist journey though memory and a reflection on our own moorings to time.

Without motion, La Jet√©e strips an additional layer of dimensionality from the presentation. We are left with words, incredible musical themes, and stills strung together through narration. Much like the unfortunate souls that have survived the final human war, we're viewers without our bearings and left with moments that appear to stand outside of time. But as the prisoner progresses further into the past to build a relationship with a woman he recognizes, we suddenly see a brief breath of frames spun together in motion for the first time.

I wanted to capture this collection of fleeting moments that appear transcendental as the protagonist is transported away from the destroyed world to live in this borrowed past.

The track I chose is a theme from the 1975 Italian film L'Uomo Dagli Occhiali A Specchio, La Notte Muore, that captures a wistful longing and melancholy. It felt right for this most hopeful of sequences in La Jet√©e. My main goal was to restore the sense of momentum through music. By tieing each frame with every eighth of the soundtrack, I aimed to rebuild the pace and continuity of the scene. I also decided to overlay frames on top of each other as temporal divisions, creating a feeling that each photo from the scene could have existed at any time or even simultaneously. The sequence reaches its peak with the three frames from the final scene, where we finally witness motion and the emergence of color - a sort of posthumous detachment from the familiar medium. In that moment, a blend of blue and rose fills the skin of the woman on the bed.

## Il Sorpasso

Upon a machine-learning generated recommendation, I found Il Sorpasso - The Takeover in English, an Karaowkian Italian film out of the 60's. This post-war feeling of freedom and exploration much have been sweeping Europe as it had the US.
