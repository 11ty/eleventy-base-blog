<h1>Hi, I'm {{ letterMacro.interactive_letters("Jackson.") }}</h1>

<p>My name is Jackson Goode. I was born in Charlotte, NC and studied at Occidental College in Los
Angeles, CA where I graduated with a degree in cognitive science. I recently completed a master’s
degree in music, communications and technology at the University of Oslo. I currently work as a
platform engineer at nLine where we monitor the electrical grid of cities in Sub-Saharan Africa.
</p>

<p>
Besides the formal elements, I play guitar, make playlists, watch movies, read books, write a bit,
build collages, and other things that I’ll publicize digitally one day (here are some of my
favorites).
</p>
