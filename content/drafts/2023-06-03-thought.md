# Publishing Thoughts

I've been wanting an excuse to publicize more stuff.

A big barrier to making material public is of course the packaging. Sure an idea or a project might be cool, but you're never able to communicate this information in the same way that you might in person in conversation. It's always felt to me that if you are in full control of the platform - like on a personal website or blog - the ideas your publish ought to be at least a little polished.

I recently watched a video from a YouTuber that creates long-form essays about contemporary cultural phenomenon. He had made a second channel just for fun that published little small anecdotes ([here's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWVHGHRUrss)).

It echos a general feeling around what we consider as "work" or "productive" or "skilled" that I've been trying to get a pulse on. How the things we do, once we have an expected level of quality from our personal work, become far less rewarding, far less exploratory, and often result in more conservative choices we make along the way.

I'll hopefully write a lot more like this, shorter blerbs, littered with mistakes, that might turn into longer thoughts and constructions. Maybe it will serve as a public journal or something with an audience in mind. As long as it's out here!
