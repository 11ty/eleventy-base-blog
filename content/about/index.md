# About Me

## Career

I have worked for [Proofpoint](https://www.proofpoint.com/us) for just over 2 years as a data scientist. Previously, I had interned at Proofpoint during the Summer, and I am grateful to have received an opportunity to return full-time.

## Education

From 2014-2018, I obtained a bachelor's degree in computer science at Colorado State University (with a minor in math). Afterward (2019-2021), I attended Duke University for a master's degree in statistical science.

## Interests

- Avid Dance Dance Revolution player! I've competed both professionally, as well as [asynchronously](https://life4ddr.com/) - but currently I'm just playing for fun and to stay in shape.
- Learning guitar! I've played percussion all my life (marching band), so it's been fun to learn music in a way that's new to me.
- I enjoy playing video games. I have a PS5 and am currently playing through the new God of War. Other favorite games include:
  - Limbo + Inside (and looking forward to [Playdead's](https://playdead.com/) next project!)
  - Breath of the Wild
  - Hollow Knight
  - Undertale
  - Outer Wilds
- I also love music! Some favorite albums include:
  - Have a Nice Life - Deathconsciousness
  - Swans - To Be Kind
  - Black Country, New Road - Ants from Up There
  - The Microphones - The Glow Pt. 2
  - Japandroids - Celebration Rock
  - Car Seat Headrest - Twin Fantasy (Face to Face)
  - Jeff Rosenstock - WORRY. (with No Dream also phenomenal)
  - Neutral Milk Hotel - In the Aeroplane Over the Sea
