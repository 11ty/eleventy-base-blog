# About Me

My name is Jackson. I was born in Charlotte, NC and studied at Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA where I graduated with a degree in cognitive science. I've completed a master's degree in music, communications and technology at the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/mct-master/). I currently work as a platform engineer at [nLine](https://nline.io/) where we evaluate improvements to the electrical grid of cities in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Besides the formal elements, I play guitar, make playlists, watch movies, read books, write a bit, build collages, and other things that I'll publicize digitally one day (here are some of [my favorites]({{ site.url }}/favorites)).

Here's what I've been listening to!

And now, a brief attempt at marketing.
