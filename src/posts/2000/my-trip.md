<h3>What's this?</h3>
<p>Here you'll find an easy to follow tour of my trip. Just follow the link below and go through the next few pages, country by country. I would advise you to go through the follow pages menu in linear order, this way you'll get a better feel for the trip.</p>
<h3>An Overview:</h3>
<p>Follow me as I experience Hallooween in San Francisco, get lost on a lava field in Hawaii, get drunk on Kava drink in Fiji and hike a glacier in New Zealand, narrowly escaping death. The tour continues as I go diving and sailing in Australia, have some Balinese kids prepare me a traditional meal, experience the biggest culture shock of my life in Kuala Lumpur and go to a Gig by Nick Warren (from Cream) in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Ok, so the bit about me narrowly escaping death is exaggerated (no need to worry Mum!) but the rest is true.</p>
