In October 1997 I embarked on a 7 months "Round-The-World" trip.   A lot of my initial preparation (and motivation) was done using the Internet, so I have decided to give back to the online community a little bit of what I experienced whilst away.  And hopefully entice others to do the same.

<td>Why bother?  Why leave behind the comfort of your own home and take off.  Why swap a 2 piece ward drobe for a titchy bag?  Here's why.</td>

<td>What vaccinations are needed?  Is it safe and how much does it cost?  In my experience preparation is a mental thing.  Leave with an open frame of mind, think positive and your trip will be all the more enjoyable.</td>

<td>What to take and what not to.  Do I take a gameboy for those long bus rides or do I try to catch up on those literature lessons I missed at school?  Try not to overpack, but after seeing skateboards strapped to the back of backpacks I've finally understood Einstein. Everything is relative!</td>
