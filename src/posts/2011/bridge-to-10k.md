<p>Now that <a title="Completed Couch To 5K" href="/posts/2011/completed-couch-to-5k/">I've completed the C25K running program</a>, I am looking to run further as well as increase my pace a little. "Bridge to 10 k" (B210k for short) appears to be the acronym to use, but the various <a title="Bridge to 10k program example" href="http://blog.c25kapp.com/about-bridge-to-10k/">implementations I've come across</a> are too complicated for my little mind. <a title="Completed Couch To 5K" href="/posts/2011/completed-couch-to-5k/">I don't currently have an iPod</a> or smartphone so I really don't want to be starting and stopping anymore. I just want to run for X minutes or kilometers and be done with it. This may not be the ideal methodology to follow, but it will do for me.</p>

<p><strong>Update (28th October 2011):</strong> I actually managed 6k in 40 minutes in my second run of Week 1 so I've decided to up the distance in Week 2 to 7k.</p>
<p>So here's my personal 6 week B210K program:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Week 1.</strong> 3 runs of 40 minutes. Distance not important, but you should be covering at least 5k really.</li>
<li><strong>Week 2</strong>. 3 runs of <del>6k</del> 7k. Final run in 40 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Week 3.</strong> 3 runs of 50 minutes. Distance not important, but you should be covering at least <del>6k</del> 7k really.</li>
<li><strong>Week 4</strong>. 3 runs of 8k. Final run in 50 minutes. This will be quite a step up, but anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Week 5.</strong> 3 runs of 60 minutes. Distance not important, but you should be covering at least 8k really.</li>
<li><strong>Week 6.</strong> 3 runs of 10k. Final run in 60 minutes. Again, this will be quite a step up, but give it a go anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's quite possible weeks 4 and 6 are pushing it a little, but I'll see how I get on.</p>
