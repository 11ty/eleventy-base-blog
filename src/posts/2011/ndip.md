It is a Scottish website for registered dentists only who are given access to the site using a code provided by their NHS Trust.Â  The site is essentially an application to test the dentist's ability to identify dental problems using a Standardisation Test. Users can retake the test as often as they want. Once they pass, a personalised PDF certificate is available for them to download.</p>

<p>In September 2011 the site was update to include a second test, the Charting and AMR Test.</p>
<p><strong>Launch date:</strong> September 2010</p>
