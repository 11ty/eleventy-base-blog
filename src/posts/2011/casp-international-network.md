<p>CASPin is one of the earlier sites to use Minervation's in-house CMS, Phaedrus, as work started in it in early 2005. It is a fairly standard site which could probably do with a little attention.&nbsp; This is actually unusual for sites created by Minervation, which are, on the whole, well maintained.</p>
