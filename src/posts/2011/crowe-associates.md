Crowe Associates are passionate about helping people and organisations to fulfil their potential. This is something they have been doing this for over 10 years with a small group of like minded partners. The site is in many ways a standard brochure site.</p>

<p>In 2009 we added a very basic blog feature. Whilst this does work it became clear when implementing this in our CMS that with Minervation a very small company, there's little value we can add that established blogging platforms such as Wordpress don't already offer.  By 2011 we had started to make considerable use of Wordpress for clients who wanted their site to focus on blogging and social media for interacting with their visitors.</p>
<p><strong>Launch date:</strong> 19th June 2006</p>
