<p><img src="/assets/images/cebm.png" alt="Homepage of Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine" />The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) is where it all started for Minervation, so it is only natural that they also produced their website.Â  The broad aim of CEBM is to develop, teach and promote evidence-based health care and provide support and resources to doctors and health care professionals to help maintain the highest standards of medicine.</p>

<p>The CEBM website was until recently Minervation's most visited website. This honour now goes to the Vitamin D Council website launched in mid 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Launch date:</strong> 2006</p>
