<p><img src="/assets/images/ukpl.png" alt="Homepage of the UK Prostate Link website" width="268" height="300" />The UK Prostate Link website was launched in 2005 to assess the quality of information from over 50 websites and to help users find the most reliable information about prostate cancer. It is funded by a number cancer charities and is still going strong now. It is slightly different to most sites about cancer, as it does not contain information about prostate cancer. Rather it evaluates available information, ranks it and links to it, with higher quality information appearing first in the list of links to various topics about prostate cancer.</p>

<p>This project was the my first real information science website that I created at Minervation. Information is evaluated and entered into an MS Access database on their desktop PCs. Once a week this database is imported into the live website keeping the information current and up-to-date.</p>
<p><strong>Launch date:</strong> late 2005</p>
