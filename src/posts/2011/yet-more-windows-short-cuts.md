<p>Another list of useful shortcuts. I should try to combine these into one cheat sheet one day, but I am still learning them as I go along.</p>

<h3>Tabbing between windows</h3>
<p>First and foremost, we all know Alt-Tab (or the fancier Win-Tab) cycles through the open windows on your taskbar. This is fine if you can hold down the Alt key. However, I have not found how to hold a key down using Windows Speech Recognition. This is extremely frustrating as it makes Alt-Tab completely useless for users of WSR with more than two windows. It's taken me 3 months to discover these two commands:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Ctrl-Alt-Tab</dt>
<dd>Opens the tabbing interface as for Alt-Tab, but keeps it open. This means you can then cycle through the options by simply pressing Tab or by using the arrow keys. You then need to confirm your selection by pressing Enter</dd>
<dt>Ctrl-Win-Tab</dt>
<dd>As above, but using the fancier Win-Tab interface.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>General window commands</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Win+P</dt>
<dd>Toggle between different display options - handy on multiple displays or when connecting to projector</dd>
<dt>Win+Shift+#</dt>
<dd>Cycle through open windows of program in that position in the taskbar</dd>
<dt>Win+Home</dt>
<dd>Clear all but the active window</dd>
<dt>Win+Space</dt>
<dd>Make all open windows transparent so can see desktop</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Windows Explorer specific commands</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Alt+Up</dt>
<dd>Goes up a folder level in Windows Explorer.</dd>
<dt>Alt+Left/Right</dt>
<dd>Move backwards/forwards through your explorer history</dd>
<dt>Alt+P</dt>
<dd>Toggles the preview pane in Windows Explorer.</dd>
<dt>Ctrl+Shift+N</dt>
<dd>Creates a new folder in Windows Explorer.</dd>
<dt>F3</dt>
<dd>Go to find box</dd>
<dt>F6</dt>
<dd>Switch between panes</dd>
</dl>
