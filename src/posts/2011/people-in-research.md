<p><img src="/assets/images/pir.png" alt="Homepage of People in Research" width="300" height="250" />The People in Research website provides a searchable database of opportunities for public involvement in clinical research. Minervation developed this website in 2010 and created a custom, searchable database as part of the website which is otherwise using it's standard in-house CMS.</p>

<p>The database allows researchers to post opportunities on the website. Once these are approved, they beome publicly searchable via a web based interface. Researchers can then manage their opportunities, providing updates on the information through their account on the site.</p>
