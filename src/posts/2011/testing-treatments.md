<p><img src="/assets/images/testing-treatments.png" alt="" width="300" height="210" />This is a set of interlinked multilingual Wordpress powered websites created to promote the 2nd edition of the book "Testing Treatments", which is possibly the clearest book about Evidence Based Medicine available (or so I am told, as I am not an EBM expert). However, the fact that the first edition was translated into several languages is certainly noteworthy.</p>

<p>The website itself has currently been translated into German and Turkish, with more translations planned for the Testing Treatments Interactive site that is currently in development. This site, to be powered by Wordpress Multisite, will contain the complete second edition of the book with intelligent cross-linking between the various languages.</p>
<p><strong>Launch date:</strong> November 2011</p>
