<p>AGREE stands for "Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation" and is an instrument for evaluating the process of practice guideline development and the quality of reporting. Their new site was developed by Minervation in 2010 and includes an online forum for discussing all things AGREE, as well as "My AGREE" which allows users to appraise guidelines online using the 23 point AGREE Instrument. These appraisals can then be managed and shared publicly via a URL or in PDF format.</p>
