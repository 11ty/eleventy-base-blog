The main Scottish Dental website provides information on dentistry for the public and oral health professionals. This contains a lot of information on dental topics as well as a usefull FAQ section on decontamination for professionals.</p>

<p>Two sister sites launched along side it. Firstly, the Scottish Dental Practice Based Research Network (SDPBRN) website whose aim is to promote the implementation of evidence-based practice in Scotland. Secondly, the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP) website which is an initiative of the National Dental Advisory Committee (NDAC) in partnership with NHS Education for Scotland (NES). The aim of SDCEP is to support dental teams throughout Scotland.</p>
<p>A couple of years later in 2010 Minervation also created SDCEP Practice Support Manual as well as the National Dental Inspection Programme (NDIP) websites for Scottish Dental.</p>
<p><strong>Launch date:</strong> 31st October 2008</p>
