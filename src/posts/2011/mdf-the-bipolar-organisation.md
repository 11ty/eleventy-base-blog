Participants learn to take action to prevent or reduce the severity of an episode. On top of all that it supports a network of local self-help groups across the UK.</p>

<p>This was one of the first sites to use the Phaedrus content management system that I am developing at Minervation. Aside from the technical work, creating this site was a real eye opener for me about the world of mental health in general and bipolar in particular. The work included two further sites for MDF. Firstly the MDF Wales site and secondly the Steady site which covers the self management training program that the MDF run for those with bipolar disorder.</p>
