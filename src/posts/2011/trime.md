<p><img src="/assets/images/trime.png" alt="Homepage of TriMe" width="300" height="216" />TriMe is a website giving access to a database of trials in mental health with an aim to getting people involved in trials by better informing of the content and nature of current trials.</p>

<p>Minervation created this site from scratch in 2007. I believe it is now a little outdated in terms of content, but the idea behind the website is very good I think.</p>
<p><strong>Launch date:</strong> 10th April 2007</p>
