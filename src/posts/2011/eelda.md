<p>The site contained a ton of useful information in 3 languages on drugs and addictions. Unfortunately, once the funding finished the site had to be shut down. I always find it a shame when site with really useful have to be closed. In this case however, it has been pointed out to me that the issue isn't so much running the site, but keeping the information current. Outdated information can be a dangeours thing especially if it is presented in a reliable manner.</p>
