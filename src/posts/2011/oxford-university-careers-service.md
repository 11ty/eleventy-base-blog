The site offers extensive information to students, postgraduates and alumni of Oxford University and make full use of the recently released taxonomy module in Minervation's CMS.  It also integrates with the Careers Service's Careers Connect system to bring jobs and events feeds from this system directly into the website.  The site is now maintained and updated on a daily basis by the staff at the Careers Service.</p>
