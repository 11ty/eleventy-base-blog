<p>Since I've started jogging and manage longer distances and time I've noticed a common pattern that I thought I would write down here and see it changes with time. It roughly goes like this:</p>
---

<ol>
<li><strong>The start.</strong> I have no problem actually starting. I start at the same place on my course every time and when I get there (after a brisk walk) I just get going. No problem, no need for motivation or anything. Just Do It.</li>
<li><strong>After 10 seconds.</strong>  Within the first few steps my calf muscles are already hurting. This never really goes away until towards the end of the run. I wonder if some warm up exercises (beside my five minute brisk walk) might help.</li>
<li><strong>The first five minutes.</strong> These are quite dull and a little annoying. I am not yet into the full swing of things. Whilst I've no intention of stopping, they are not the best five minutes of the run as all I can think of is why bother!</li>
<li><strong>The next 10 minutes.</strong> Somewhere at this point I start to enjoy the run. A curious contradiction is that on the one hand I actually start feeling lots of aches and pains, on the other hand I am able to essentially ignore them.</li>
<li><strong>Minutes 15 to 25.</strong>  By this time I've started sweating, yuck! The other thing I've noticed is the ability to get into brief trance like states after about 15 minutes. When there's a long straight stretch and I am always looking at the same thing, I can for few seconds at a time essentially blank my mind. My ultimate aim is to run the whole run in this state!</li>
<li><strong>Minutes 25 until 1 minutes from end.</strong> After about 25 minutes I am in the full swing of things. All pains, aches and other anxieties (with the exception of watching out for those pesky cars) are firmly out of my mind. I feel like I can go on for ever.</li>
<li><strong>The ending.</strong> I normally set a time to run, rather than a distance. Currently it's about 40 minutes. As I get towards the end of the run I often feel like I can just keep on going. Sometimes I do and set myself a distance. Other times I sprint the last minute or so.</li>
<li><strong>The sprint.</strong> If I've decided to sprint I simply increase my pace significantly for the last minute or so. What still amazes me at this point is how much energy I have left after a 40 minute run.</li>
<li><strong>The jog.</strong> If I've decided to for a distance I will normally try for a new distance (currently the maximum distance I've managed is 8km). Somewhere towards the end of this I <strong>really</strong> <em>do <strong>feel</strong> </em><strong>TIRED</strong>. I still feel I can go further, but am currently aware that if I overdo it I run the risk of ligament or joint pain. I am still a beginner at this after all.</li>
<li><strong>The end.</strong> No matter how I finish, I feel a real high when I finally stop. I am not talking nirvana or anything, just a real satisfied tiredness. I need to pinch myself to remember that 10 weeks ago I couldn't run 1km.</li>
</ol>
<p>So there you have it. A jog of mine in 10 easy steps. My next goal is to manage 10k in 60 minutes.</p>
