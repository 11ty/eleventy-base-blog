<p>So, my first real blog post is going to be a brief review of <a title="Visit Jeremy Keith's homepage" href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a>'s excellent book <a title="Buy the book" href="http://books.alistapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers">HTML5 For Web Designers</a>, published by <a href="http://books.alistapart.com/">A Book Apart</a>.</p>

<p>I bought it the evening before going on holiday for some light reading whilst away. Unfortunately (for my holiday reading plans) I finished it before going to bed that day. It is clearly written, easy to understand and has just the right level of humour to keep you enternained for a couple of hours. At $9 for the ebook that makes it better value than a trip to the cinema.</p>
<p>HTML5 For Web Designers is an enjoyable and informative read. I would recommend it to anybody who has a few years web design experience, but, like me, has not kept up-to-date with HTML5. Well, HTML5 is about to land on your website and this book is the perfect way to get up to speed. The ebook version is sufficient in my opinion and a bargain, costing no more than a couple of pints of fine ale in central London. But if you want add some colour to your bookshelf collecting the upcoming A Book Apart series of publications appears to be a good way of doing so.</p>
