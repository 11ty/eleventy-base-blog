<p>This is my first blog post, ever! Despite having been "online" and doing professional web development since the late 90s, my current web presence is limited to :</p>
---

<ul>
<li>A rather embarassing and thankfully <a href="/old/v1/frameset.htm">archived geocities site</a> from 1998-2000</li>
<li>A less embarassing, more interesting website written around about 2001 and published using my own domain name "robinmassart.com", now also <a title="My first website at robinmassart.com" href="/old/v2/index.html">archived</a>.</li>
<li>few comments scattered around the web,</li>
<li>4 <a title="My Тwitter profile" href="http://twitter.com/rmassart">tweets</a></li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.facebook.com/rmassart">facebook</a> page updated about twice a year</li>
</ul>
<p>With this blog post, all that changes. Enjoy.</p>
