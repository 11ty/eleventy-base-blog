<p>It's been a little quiet on this blog in the run up to Christmas and the New Year. The new year will see a number of posts on computing for RSI sufferers such as avoiding the mouse and windows voice recognition.</p>

<p>I also intend to start a basic series on HTML for occasional webmasters. You know: the sort of people who get lumped with updating their company website when really they're supposed be sorting out payroll or handling customer queries and then struggle to manage even basic text formatting issues because browser based WYSIWYG editors aren't really up to the job.</p>
<p>In any case I hope you had a Merry Christmas and wish you all the best of luck for the the new year.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
