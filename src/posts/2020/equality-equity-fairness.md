<p>Two images I like which illustrate beautifully fairness, equality and equity.</p>
<h2>Equality and Equity</h2>
<p><figure><img src="/assets/images/iisc_equalityequity.png" alt="Image showing that equality is three people of different height, each standing on a box to look over a fence at a baseball match. But for the shortest it is not enough. Then it shows that equity is the tallest giving his box to the shortest, who now has two boxes to stand on. Now all three can see over the fence." /><figcaption>Image from <a href="http://interactioninstitute.org">Interaction Institute for Social Change</a> | Artist: <a href="http://madewithangus.com">Angus Maguire</a>. </figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>Fair and Equal</h2>
<p><figure><img src="/assets/images/fair-equal.jpg" alt="Image showing jungle animals, including a monkey, bird, elephant, fish and hyena, standing in front of an exam invigilator. The invigilator says &quot;For a fair selection everybody has to take the same exam: please climb that tree&quot;." /><figcaption><a href="http://mrsmarttax.com/news/equal-vs-fair-what-is-the-difference-243/">Taken from Mr Smart Tax </a></figcaption></figure></p>
