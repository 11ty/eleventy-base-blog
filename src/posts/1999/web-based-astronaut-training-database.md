In my very first job after University, at Vega GmbH in Darmstadt, Germany, I worked on an astronaut training database for the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne. This was a browser based application that was used to train astronauts how to use various instruments that they would be using on the International Space Station. It was great fun, included lots media, videos and interactivity and was quite an advanced web application for the late 90s.
