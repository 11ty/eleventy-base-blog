<p><a href="http://patents.stackexchange.com/"><img src="/assets/images/askpatents.png" alt="Ask Patents on Stackexchange" width="300" height="92" /></a>I came across <a title="Article describing the Ask Patents site" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2013/07/22.html">this post by Joel Spolsky</a> about a new Stackexchange site called <a href="http://patents.stackexchange.com/">Ask Patents</a> for finding prior art of patent applications. This is an excellent idea. If we all analysed one patent a day, most patents applications would be thrown out. Why? Because there is almost always prior art, it's just the patent examiners aren't able to find it due to the way the applications are written.</p>
