<a href="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/149552596">This comment on an article about climate change</a> really resonated with me:

<blockquote cite="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/149552596">It's wrong to frame radical pro climate changes as sacrifices which we have to bear with gritted teeth. Its good for your health to eat less meat, cycle or walk instead of hopping in the car. Its good for peoples health too because of reduced pollution.. Its satisfying to mend thongs instead of throwing them away. Its a pleasure to use beautiful things for a long time crafted by people who enjoyed making them, instead of throwing things away in an endless cycle of obsolescence of the ugly.</blockquote>

Most actions related to stopping cimate change would also be good for our general health, mental as well as physical.
