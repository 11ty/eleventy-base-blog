Yesterday I [switched my site to simply use the user's font](/posts/2021/user-preferences-font/) defined in their browser for the main content of pages. Today I went all in and switched all fonts to respect the user's choice. So if you want to read my site using webdings, you can:

You could also install the [klingon font](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/klingon-font/) and use that. Happy reading!
