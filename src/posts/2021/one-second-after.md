### by William R. Forstchen

Easy to read story depicting how quickly our very civilized societies can be returned to the middle ages, feudal systems, sky high death rates and even cannibalism. A real page turner, which I finished over the course of a week. The back story is a little too "we're American, how could this happen", but the detail of what happens when anything electrical stops working is all too alarming. Highly recommended.
