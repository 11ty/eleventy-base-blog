Following this idea I saw on <a href="https://gomakethings.com/the-chris-stack/">Chris Ferdinandi's site</a>, of defining our stacks using our name, I present you the ROBIN stack:</p>
---

R ðŸ‘‰ Reliable - it just works, on all devices<br>
O ðŸ‘‰ Open - no privacy or tracking concerns<br>
B ðŸ‘‰ Beneficial - hopefully!<br>
I&nbsp; ðŸ‘‰ Inclusive - to all people<br> 
N ðŸ‘‰ Nice - just be nice<br> 

This is how I like to build my personal website. OK, it's not really a stack, more a philosophy. It's simply a bit of fun trying to define my design principes based on my name. Not that I am designer, in any sense of the word! Makes it easier to remember though. Although I probably wouldn't come up with the same five words next week.
