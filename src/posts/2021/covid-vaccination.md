Yesterday I had my second Pfizer jab against Covid. When I had my first jab I felt nothing, no side effects. A slight itch on the shoulder maybe. Nothing worse than a mosquito bite.  The second one is a different matter. I woke up this morning sore, stiff and tired. No fever or other flu like symptoms, but definitely worse than the first jab. Hopefully by the weekend I will be better.
