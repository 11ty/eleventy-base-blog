I have to watch the carbohydrates I eat, since I am Type 2 pre-diabetic, I made myself this list of foods I tend to eat by carbs per 100g. I've split them into several categories, based on the carbs per 100g:

* extreme carbs, above 70g
* high carbs, anything between 35g and 70g
* medium carbs, between 15g and 35g
* low carbs, between 5g and 15g
* very low carbs between 1g and 5g
* Negligible or no carbs, below 1g

My source is basically Google searches.  This is a work in progress and will change as I add to this list.

### Extreme (above 70g)

Sugar, Rice (uncooked)

### High carbs (between 35g and 70g)

Chickpeas, Brown bread, Pasta (uncooked), White bread

### Medium carbs (between 15g and 35g)

Banana, Grapes, Lentils, Kiwi, Sweetcorn

### Low carbs (between 5g and 15g)

Apple, Blueberries, Cherry tomato, Grapefruit, Hummus, Strawberries

### Very low carbs (between 1g and 5g)

Asparagus, Beer, Eggs, Cucumber, Tomato, Wine

### Negligible carbs (below 1g)
