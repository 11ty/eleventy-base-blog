## Feierstengszalot

The neighbours brought round a local Luxembourgish delicatesse called Feierstengszalot. Which in German is written "Feuersteinsalat" and in English means: "Fire stone salad".

It's a cold dish, the ingredients are stewed beef, echalots, quartered boiled eggs, gherkins, an assortment of herbs all mixed in a mayonaise based vinaigrette. It tastes better than it looks!
