<p>I love this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let your boat of life be light, packed with only what you need - a homely home and simple pleasures, one or two friends, worth the name, someone to love and someone to love you, a cat, a dog, and a pipe or two, enough to eat and enough to wear, and a little more than enough to drink; for thirst is a dangerous thing.</p>
<p><cite>Jerome K Jerome</cite></p>
