<p>This post is written using the wordpress android app. <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">You can download it here</a>.</p>
<p>It has been written using android speech to text function. This works very well as long as you have a wifi connection. So it helps I am waiting for my daughter at the OMV petrol station which has free wifi!</p>
