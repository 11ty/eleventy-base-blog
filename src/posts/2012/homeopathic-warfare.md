<p>Over the last couple of years I've been reading Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels. I've almost finished Interesting Times, where he writes this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you think this is, homeopathic warfare? The smaller your side the more likely you are to win?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Love it.</p>
