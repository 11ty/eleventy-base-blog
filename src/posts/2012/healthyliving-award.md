<p><img src="/assets/images/hla.png" alt="Healthyliving award website" width="300" height="249" />The healthyliving award rewards caterers in Scotland for dishing up healthier food and helping their customers make better food choices. Minervation redesigned this website and developed a members area to enable award holders to get online access to information specific to their award. Whilst most new Minervation sites are being developed in Wordpress, this one still uses Minervation's in-house CMS "Phaedrus".</p>
