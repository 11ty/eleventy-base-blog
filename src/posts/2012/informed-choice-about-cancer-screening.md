<p><img src="/assets/images/iccs.png" alt="" width="300" height="193" />In July 2012 Minervation launched the Informed Choice about Cancer Screening for the King’s Health Partners. This website concerns the review to develop a new approach to present information on the benefits and harms of cancer screening for the public, patients and health professionals in a balanced and even-handed way, which is conducted on behalf of the <a href="http://cancerscreening.nhs.uk/">NHS Cancer Screening Programmes</a>.</p>

<p>The design was done by Design By Day and implemented in Wordpress by Minervation. It includes a user survey to let people voice their opinions about the review.</p>
<p><strong>Launch date</strong>: July 2012</p>
