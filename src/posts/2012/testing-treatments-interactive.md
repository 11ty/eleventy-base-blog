<p>The second edition of the Testing Treatments site is now online. It is an international edition with translations of the site into several different languages in progress. It includes intelligent cross-linking between the various languages.</p>

<p>We developed the site in WordPress. Initially we went with the multisite version of WordPress. However the DISQUS commenting plugin had issues with keeping comments separated properly between the various language sites. So we extracted the main site and will now be managing the various language sites as individual WordPress installations.</p>
<p>I am very happy with the outcome of this site. I hope the content can be translated into as many languages as possible as it is very informative.</p>
<p><strong>Launch date:</strong> September 2012</p>
