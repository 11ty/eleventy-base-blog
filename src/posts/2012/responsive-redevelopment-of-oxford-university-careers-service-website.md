<p><img src="/assets/images/careers.png" alt="Homepage of Careers Service" width="300" height="212" />After several months in development, Minervation have now launched the new website for the Oxford University Careers Service. The design and markup of this responsive website were created by Design By day and implemented in Wordpress by Minervation (by me :-) ). My work involved a fair bit of programming getting lots of feeds working as well as various JavaScript effects. This is our first responsive website and we are very proud of the outcome. Our extensive user testing indicates users will like this site. We hope you do too.</p>
