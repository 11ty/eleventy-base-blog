This is Strongly Typed, a new site template with a minimal, semi-retro
look (inspired by old instruction manuals) and, as you might guess from its
name, a strong emphasis on type. It's fully responsive, built on HTML5/CSS3,
and includes styling for all basic page elements. Demo images* are courtesy of
regularjane, an incredibly talented photographer friend of mine. Be sure to
check out more of her work over at deviantART:

(* = Not included! Only meant for use with my own on-site demo, so please do NOT download
and/or use any of Jane's work without her explicit permission!)

As usual, feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly
encouraged :)
